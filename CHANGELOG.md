# Puzzle Shell Changelog

# 4.0.0

- BREAKING CHANGE: Provide JavaScript modules (ES2021) with TypeScript definitions in addition to the pre-bundled version which includes Lit. This is the [recommended way of publishing Web Components](https://lit.dev/docs/tools/publishing/#publishing-modern-javascript) and allows to deduplicate Lit. Unfortunately this change breaks with the existing import paths (see [README.md](./README.md#usage) for more details):
  - Bundled:
    - `@puzzleitc/puzzle-shell` → `@puzzleitc/puzzle-shell/bundle.js` <br>
      or via CDN: `https://unpkg.com/@puzzleitc/puzzle-shell/dist/puzzle-shell.js` → `https://unpkg.com/@puzzleitc/puzzle-shell/dist/bundle.js`
    - `@puzzleitc/puzzle-shell/dist/style.css` → `@puzzleitc/puzzle-shell/style.css` <br>
      or via CDN: `https://unpkg.com/@puzzleitc/puzzle-shell/dist/style.css` (no change)
  - JavaScript modules (new):
    - `import "@puzzleitc/puzzle-shell"` (all components)
    - `import "@puzzleitc/puzzle-shell/components/Topbar.js"` (specific components)
- Update the dependencies (including upgrade to Lit 3 & Vite 5, using Node 20).

# 3.0.1

- Allow overflowing in `pzsh-banner` to fix cropped dropdowns within the component's content slot.

# 3.0.0

- BREAKING CHANGE: Switch to self-hosting of Roboto fonts instead of fetching from Google. This improves privacy and performance but means you now have to include `dist/style.css` in your project for the fonts to be working.
- Allow mobile/desktop breakpoint to be customized via the global `window.pzshBreakpoint` property.
- Prevent body from scrolling while `pzsh-menu` is open on mobile. Use the `scrollContainerSelector` attribute to configure a custom scroll container.
- Enable overflowing (scrolling) for `pzsh-menu` content larger than screen height.
- Add GitHub Actions Workflow to generate BOM (bill of materials) file and push it to Dependency Track.
- Add missing logos to logo story

# 2.0.0

- Migrate to Vite setup, upgrade to Storybook 7.3 and update all other dependencies. This eliminates all vulnerabilities reported by `npm audit`.
- Migrate to TypeScript, include `.d.ts` files in package.
- BREAKING CHANGE: The main entry file is now `dist/puzzle-shell.js`, previously it was `index.js`.

# 1.0.1

- Fix click/keydown event registering without useCapture
